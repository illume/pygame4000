awesome libraries for pygame
----------------------------

- available via pip
- documented (with examples, and API docs)
- generally awesome for some reason (even if not perfect, maybe it has potential)


Where to begin? ...

- `mu-editor <https://github.com/mu-editor/mu>`__ - an editor for beginners. It also comes bundled with pygame and pgzero. The main idea of Mu is that you use a simplified but real editor to begin with, and then to leave it behind once you advance.
- `Thonny <https://thonny.org/>`__ - is another python editor for beginners.


- `A Little Bit of Widgetry for PyGame <https://github.com/hasii2011/albow-python-3>`__ - A GUI library for pygame. This is a fork of the original Albow library, but it works with python 3 and has been updated since then.
- `Thorpy <http://www.thorpy.org/>`__ - a GUI library for pygame.


- `pymunk <http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/>`__ - 2d physics library. Lots of examples, very well maintained.


- `pyscroll <https://github.com/bitcraft/pyscroll>`__ - Scrolling maps. Fast scrolling images easy.
- `pyTMX <https://github.com/bitcraft/pytmx>`__ - Reads Tiled Map Editors TMX maps. Can use a Map editor easily.
- `pyinstaller <https://www.pyinstaller.org/>`__ - Make installers for different platforms. Very easy to use to make installers.
- `animation <https://github.com/bitcraft/animation>`__ - Tasks and tweening using pygame groups. No framework needed to smoothly move sprites or execute things over time.


- `symplehfsm <https://bitbucket.org/dr0id/symplehfsm/overview>`__ - hierarchial state machine.
- `spritesheetlib <https://bitbucket.org/dr0id/spritesheetlib>`__ - loading sprite sheets.
- `pyknic <https://bitbucket.org/dr0id/pyknic>`__ - collection of useful tools (tweening, animation, context, timing, fonts, spritesystem, skeleton, ...) for games.
- `pytmxloader <https://bitbucket.org/dr0id/pytmxloader>`__ - Map loader for tmx files


- `pygame-text <https://github.com/cosmologicon/pygame-text>`__ - Greatly simplifies drawing text with the pygame.font module.
- `pygame-menu <https://github.com/ppizarror/pygame-menu>`__ - A menu for pygame, simple, lightweight and easy to use.
- `TextBoxify <https://github.com/hnrkcode/TextBoxify>`__ - package to easily create dialog boxes for games. Want to show a character talking, with a box of text next to it? Then this is for you.


- `pgzero <https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ - a framework for games built on top of pygame. Intended for education.
- `Wasabi2d <https://github.com/lordmauve/wasabi2d>`__ - another game framework by lordmauve, this time it's cutting edge.
- `moderngl <https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl>`__ - Modern OpenGL bindings for python.
- `PyGLM on GitHub <https://github.com/Zuzu-Typ/PyGLM>`__ comes with perlin and simplex noise (2D, 3D and 4D), matrix transformations, quaternions, vectors and other GLSL type goodies.
